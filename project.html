   <h1>Gym Management System (DBMS Project)</h1>
 <p>I developed a Gym Management System with a primary focus on Database Management using SQL. The system maintained member records, trainer details, workout schedules, and payment information in a structured relational database. By implementing queries, joins, and constraints, I ensured data integrity, easy retrieval, and efficient management of gym operations. This project strengthened my understanding of DBMS concepts such as normalization, relational schema design, and SQL query optimization, while also integrating a simple front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript..</p>

     <h1>Random Color Generator (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</h1>
 <p>I developed a Random Color Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which dynamically produces colors with each click. The project displayed the generated color along with its HEX/RGB code, allowing users to copy and use them. This project improved my understanding of JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and color code generation, while strengthening my practical coding skills.</p>
